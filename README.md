Moviebucket Overview
Moviebucket is designed as a movie search web application, allowing users to explore a diverse collection of movies. While the project includes essential features for movie search and display, it's important to note that due to time constraints, certain features were not fully implemented.

Unimplemented Features
Key Protection: In the current version, the project does not include a backend service within Next.js to secure API keys. It's recommended to implement a backend service to safeguard sensitive information.

Actor/Actress Movie History: A planned feature to explore the filmography of actors/actresses did not make it to the current version. This functionality would have allowed users to click on an actor/actress and discover the movies they are featured in.

Known Issues
Despite my best efforts, there may be some small bugs present in the application. I acknowledge the existence of these issues and plan to address them in future updates.
